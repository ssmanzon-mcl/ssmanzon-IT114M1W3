// Checkpoint 3.1 How would you compare lists in python vs arrays in JavaScript
// Answer: 
Python Lists: Can contain elements of different data types, and the type of the list can change dynamically.
JavaScript Arrays: Can also contain elements of different data types, but JavaScript itself is dynamically typed, so the type of the array can change dynamically.

// Checkpoint 3.2 What would be the equivalent of objects in python? How would you compare them?
// Answer: 
JavaScript objects are often used as prototypes for creating instances using constructor functions or classes.
Python dictionaries are part of the core language and are used widely for various purposes.
